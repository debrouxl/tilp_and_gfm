the Connect85 link support.

progress.

- 3/12/1999: version 0.36_1.93_devel: I have improved the TI82 support. It

have also modified the directory list display to prepare the future drag&drop.
Yeah !!!

- 26/11/1999: version 0.34_1.91_devel: I go on the TI83 support. For this,
I translate varname in a more useful varname (translate).

- 25/11/1999: version 0.34_1.90_devel: I have added a right button
popup menu and I have implemented the import/export. There is another
programmer which look after developing import/export TIGL files.

- 19/11/1999: version 0.33_1.90_devel: I begin the support of TI83. It works
so so but I will improve it the next week.

it works fine. Moreover, the device (/dev/ttyS) is locked for protection.
At last, the command line parameters work correctly.

- 18/11/1999: version 0.32_1.87_devel: I modified the sources to
compile on SPARC station. I have managed to run gtktilink on a SPARC station.
No bugs.

- 13/11/1999: version 0.32_1.86_stable: the Grey TI Graph Link is now 
supported. Yeah !!! But I did not understand how ?!?!. Indeed, I did not
modified the tiglink.c source !!!

- 5/11/1999: version 0.31_1.85_stable: I corrected a few small defaults.
I have added the full/local path support.

- 2/11/1999: version 0.24_1.84_stable: full support of TI89.
	     version 0.30_1.85_devel: I begin the support of TI82.

- 1/11/1999: version 0.23_1.83_stable: full support of TI92+.
	     version 0.24_1.83_stable: I corrected a few small defaults.
	     version 0.24_1.84_stable: I modified the TI92 file format
in order to have some homogeneousness in the different calc file formats.

- 31/10/1999: version 0.22_1.82_stable: I modified the ti92.c file because 
it does not follow exactly the protocol.
It appeared that the get function of the tiglink.c is not enough fast for not 
to lost some bytes. An interrupt routine is so necessary (help me !!!!).
I will go on the TIGL development later.

- 30/10/1999, version 0.22_1.82_devel: I go on the support of TIGL Black.

- 29/10/1999, version 0.21_1.81_stable: a bug in the options menu has been
corrected. The gtktilink rc file is now in the home directory of the user.
I find a bug in serial link routines (ioperm). It is now corrected.
I corrected a bug in the dirlist. The dirlist was be able to function only 
with a TI92.
I renamed some keys definitions in the ti .h files
I corrected a visualisation default: the receiving bcakup progress box does
not appear correctly.

they do not break (timeout).

-28/09/1999, version 0.1-1.7: I cleaned the C files because they contains some unused variables, I modified the varinfo struct and so the TIxx files.

- 05/09/1999, version 0.1-1.6: I modified some headers files and I modified 
the ti_link.c file in order to use function pointers.

- 05/09/1999, version 0.1-1.6: I modified the screendump routines in order to
these routines are screen size independant.

- 03/08/1999, version 0.0-0.6: sending variable implemented

- 02/08/1999, version 0.0-0.5: receiving variable implemented
