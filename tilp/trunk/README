DESCRIPTION
-----------

TiLP is a program allowing a PC to communicate with 
a TI calculator.

It works on Linux, Windows, Mac OS-X and FreeBSD platforms.
See README.linux, README.win32 or README.freebsd according to your
platform for more informations.

All physical link cables are supported by TiLP: parallel, serial, 
BlackLink, GrayLink, AVRlink, SilverLink and DirectLink.
TiLP also support some virtual links: one for VirtualTI, the other one for
GtkTiEmu.

Note1: the SilverLink cable may not work fine TI82/85.
Note2: remote control is not supported by DirectLink yet.

Supported calculators are: 
	TI73, TI82, TI83, TI83+(SE), TI84+(SE), TI85, TI86, 
	TI89, TI89 Titanium, TI92, TI92+ and V200,
	NSpire (non-CAS).


FEATURES
--------

Note: some features may depend on the OS version. Be sure to have the latest one !

NSpire:
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving file
  - upgrading OS
  - version

TI89/TI89 Titanium/TI92+/V200:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM dump
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (AMS)
  - getting/setting time (need AMS >= 2.08)

TI92:
  - remote control of the calculator
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving backup
  - ROM version
  - ROM dump (FARGO II required)

TI86:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup (old & new ti86 calcs)
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI85:
  - screen dump
  - sending/receiving backup
  - sending/receiving variable
  - TIGL file support
  - ROM dump

TI83+/TI84+ (SE or not SE):
  - screen dump
  - directory list
  - sending/receiving backup (archived vars are not backed up !)
  - sending/receiving/deleting variable
  - sending/receiving/deleting FLASH applications
  - upgrading of Operating System (GRAPH EXPLORER SOFTWARE)

Note: the TI83+ is the only calc to have a GROUP variable. TiLP supports it in
a specific way: this kind of var is saved as a single file as any other
variable. Thus, if you send it, it will stay grouped on calc.
The TI's software has a different way: it explodes the GROUP variable
into a .8Xg group file and you lose the grouping on calculator.
