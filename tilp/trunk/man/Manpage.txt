NAME
       TiLP - a communication program for TI calculators ('Ti Linking Program'
       or 'Tilp is a Linking Program')

SYNOPSYS
       tilp  [--help]  [--version]  [-h]  [-v]  [-calc=]  [-link=]  [-port=  ]
       [-adr_port=]  [-dev_port=]  [-timeout=]  [-delay=]  [-cmdline]  [-gui=]
       [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The TiLP program allows you to backup, restore and archive variables of
       your  Texas  Intruments  calculator on your computer. It has also addi-
       tional features such as screen dump, remote control, ROM  dump,  FLASH-
       ing.  TiLP is a very complete program. Moreover, you have the same pro-
       gram for all calculator types.

OPTIONS
       The command line of tilp can be  used  for  sending  or  opening  files
       (variables, backup, FLASH apps, OS, ...). For sending one or more file,
       simply pass the filename(s) on  the  command  line  with  the  -cmdline
       option.  If  you  don't  use the -cmdline option, the file will be open
       within the GUI by the Group File Manager.

       It is possible to send one or more files (single/group  file  only)  or
       one  file  which can be a single/group var as well as a backup, a FLASH
       app or an Operating System even. You can not do any  other  operations.
       If  you  want  more  operations,  you  can  use  the  interactive  mode
       (-gui=console).

       Note: options must be passed before the filename !

       tilp accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       -cmdline
              Send file(s)  without  launching  any  Graphic  User  Interface.
              Informations are displayed in the terminal.

       -gui=  Use  a  specific  graphic  interface.  You  can choose 'console'
              (prompt), or 'gtk' (GTK+).  In console mode, you can enter  some
              commands.  There  are several commands which allow you to do the
              same things that you could do in GUI mode. These  commands  are:
              ready, screen [filename], dirlist [filename], backup [filename],
              restore [filename], send [filename]  (variable,  FLASHapp,  OS),
              receive [filename] and dump [filename] (ROM).

       -calc= Select  a  calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89, ti86, ti85,
              ti83+, ti83, ti82 or ti73.

       -link= Select a link cable  type:  Grey  TIGraphLink  (tgl),  home-made
              serial  or  Black  TIGraphLink  (ser),  home-made  parallel link
              (par), fastAVRlink (avr), generic virtual link (vtl), TIEmulator
              virtual link (tie), VTi virtual link (vti), TI/PC USB link (tpu)
              or USB TIGraphLink also known as SilverLink (slv).

       -port= Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can  be  any
              value between 1 and 2, 3 or 4 (depending on link cable).

       -adr_port=
              Optionnal.  Override  value  passed  with -port.  This value can
              represent either a direct address, either a link number, accord-
              ing  to  the  link type. It will override the address associated
              with the port specified in the config  file.   Give  the  direct
              address  of  the parallel port (0x3BC, 0x378 or 0x278) or serial
              port (0x3F8, 0x2F8, 0x3E8 or 0x2E8), depending of the link cable
              type.   Give  the link number of the virtual link (1 -> #0, 2 ->
              #1).  Give the link mode of the TI/PC USB link (1 -> 'raw' mode,
              2 -> 'cooked' mode).

       -dev_port=
              Optionnal.  Override  value passed with -port.  It will override
              the device associated with the  port  specified  in  the  config
              file.   Give  the  serial  port device (/dev/ttyS[0..3]) for the
              Grey TIGraphLink  or  the  fastAVRlink.   Give  the  USB  device
              (/dev/tiglusb[0..3]).

       -timeout=
              in  tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while the program
              wait a response of the calculator. Once this delay elapsed,  the
              program send a time out error. The default value is 1 seconds.

       -delay=
              in  microseconds.  This is the time which separate the transmis-
              sion of 2 bytes.  The default value is 5 microseconds.  Decrease
              this  value  increase the transfer speed but decrease the relia-
              bility of the transmission.

EXAMPLE
       Quicly send (no gui) an TI89 file with a BlackLink cable on the  second
       serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2); timeout is set to 2s:

       tilp -cmdline -calc=ti89 -link=serial -port=2 -timeout=20   group.89g

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This  section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is in
       the home directory of the user (Linux) or the  tilp.ini  file  (Win32).
       The  file  is  separated  into  several  sections (hardware, gui, calc,
       external programs, fonts, screen, misc). But, there is  no  order,  you
       can  write  lines  as you want.  A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a
       comment. Each line has the  following  format:  option=something.   The
       config  file  must  have the 'RC_END' string at end.  Every line can be
       put in any order. Beware: any comment added to the file will  be  over-
       written !  Below is described each option and the possible values:

       version=  Which  version  of  TiLP has written the config file. Used to
       display the Release the file and to keep compatibility.

       calctype= Defines the calculator type.  Choose  one  of  the  following
       value: ti82, ti83, ti83+, ti85, ti86, ti89, ti92, ti92+, v200.

       linktype=  Define  the  link  cable  type.  Choose one of the following
       value: TIGraphLink, parallel, serial,  AVRlink,  fastAVRlink,  virtual,
       TiEmulator, VTi, UsbGraphLink, TiPcUsbLink.

       port=  Define  the port to use. You have to choose one of the following
       value depending on your link cable type and the port you want use: par-
       allel  port  #[1-3],  serial port #[1-4], virtual port #[1-2], USB port
       #[1-4].

       method= You can specify here an I/O management method to use.  You  can
       choose:  automatic, asm, api and driver. Non-expert users should choose
       automatic. The libticables library  will  automatically  determine  the
       best method.

       adr_port=  If  you specify a value, this will override the default set-
       tings associated with the port value.  Define the I/O  address  of  the
       I/O  port to use. It can be 0x3F8 for a serial port or 0x378 for a par-
       allel port for instance.

       serial_device= If you specify a value, this will override  the  default
       settings  associated  with  the  port value.  Define the device name to
       use.

       baudrate= If you have a fastAVRlink cable, you may  have  to  pass  the
       link cable speed. This value must be the same than the cable one.

       timeout=  with  the  timeout  value to use in tenth of seconds. Default
       value: 20.

       delay= with the delay value  to  use  in  micro-seconds  for  home-made
       cables. Default value: 10

       rts_cts=  Enable  (on)  or  disable  (off)  the  hardware  flow control
       (RTS/CTS method) for the fastAVRlink cable. Disable it can decrease the
       reliability of transfers unless you decrease the link speed. Above 9600
       bauds, flow control is recommended.


       xsize= and ysize= Gives the X and Y values of the size of the left win-
       dow. Default values: 300 and 400.

       clist_sort=  Define the sorting method for the right window. Choose one
       of the following value: name, date, size, user, group, attrib

       clist_order= Define the sorting order  for  the  right  window.  Choose
       either 'up' or 'down'.

       ctree_sort=  Define  the sorting method for the left window. Choose one
       of the following value: name, info, type, size

       ctree_order= Define the sorting  order  for  the  left  window.  Choose
       either 'up' or 'down'.

       file_display=  Define  whether  tilp  shows only TI files or all files.
       Possible values are 'ti' or 'all'.

       confirm= Define whether tilp ask you confirmation when you delete  some
       files. Use carefully !!! You can choose 'yes' or 'no'

       console=  Define whether tilp will display some verbose informations or
       not. Under Win32, this will display a background console. Values: 'yes'
       or 'no'.

       show_gui= Display the Graphic User Interface in command line mode. Val-
       ues: 'yes' or 'no'.

       single_or_group= Receive set of files as a single file or as a  grouped
       file. Values: 'single' or 'group'.

       use_checksum= Unimplemented yet.

       path=  Define whether tilp sends the variable in its original folder or
       in the locurrent folder. Choose either 'full' or  'local'.  Works  only
       for TI89/92/92+.

       probe_ti=  Define  whether  tilp  will try and determine the calculator
       automagically. Works only for TI73, TI83+, TI89 and TI92+  calculators.
       Values: 'yes' or 'no'.

       unzip_location= Define the location of the program to use for unzipping
       archives. Most of the time, the 'unzip' string is enough.

       unzip_options= Define the options to pass on the command  line  of  the
       'unzip'  program. By default, all files of the ZIP archive are deflated
       in a directory such as 'archive_name/'. An option such  as  'unzip_fil-
       ter=*.89* -d tidir/' can be useful too.

       tar_location=   Define  the  location  of  the  program  for  untarring
       archives. Most of the time, the 'tar' string is enough.

       tar_options= Define the options to pass on  the  command  line  of  the
       'tar'  program. By default, this option is equal to 'tar_options=xvzf'.

       web_location= Define the location of the browser. Mozilla  is  used  by
       default: /usr/bin/mozilla.

       web_options=  Define  the  options  to  pass on the command line of the
       'browser' program. By default, there is no option.

       left_font_name= Define the font to use in the left window (calc files).
       The font is described by its XFLD (X-Font Logical Description) name.

       right_font_name=  Define  the font to use in the right window (computer
       files). The font is described  by  its  XFLD  name,  such  as:  -adobe-
       courier-medium-r-*-*-*-125-*-*-*-*-*-*

       screen_mode=  Define whether tilp display the entire screen of the cal-
       culator or only the visible part. This option is only useful  for  TI89
       calculators  because  they have a screen which has the same size than a
       TI92 one but only a part is displayed. The other part is  only  useable
       via ASM programming.

       screen_format=  Define  the  image format to use for saving screen cap-
       tures. It can be 'jpg' or 'png'. Previous format such as  'xpm',  'pcx'
       or 'bmp' are not supported any longer.

       screen_blurry= Define whether the image is saved in B&W or saved like a
       VTi image (dark & light gray). Values: 'yes' or 'no'.

       locale= Override the default locale ("C" most of the time). Must  be  a
       string such as 'fr_FR' or 'en _US' for instance.

       working_dir= Contains the directory that TiLP will list at startup. Can
       be changed from the popup menu.

       Think to terminate your config script with the 'RC_END' word !!!
