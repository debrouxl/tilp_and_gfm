NAME
       TiLP2  - a communication program for TI calculators ('Tilp Is a Linking
       Program')

SYNOPSYS
       tilp [--help] [--version] [-h] [-v]  [--calc=]  [--cable=]  [--port=  ]
       [--timeout=] [--delay=] [--no-gui] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The  TiLP  program  allows you to backup, restore and archive variables
       and/or applications of your Texas Intruments calculator  on  your  com-
       puter. It has also additional features such as screen dump, remote con-
       trol, ROM dump, FLASHing. TiLP is a very  complete  program.  Moreover,
       you have the same program for all calculator models.

OPTIONS
       The  command line of tilp can be used for sending files like variables,
       backup, FLASH apps, OS, TiGroup, ....  You can not do any other  opera-
       tions. If you want more operations, you have to use the GUI.  For send-
       ing one or more file, simply pass the filename(s) on the command  line.
       If you want to use TiLP from console, use the --no-gui switch.

       Take care: options must be passed before the filename !

       tilp accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       --no-gui, -n
              Send file(s) without launching any Graphical User Interface. All
              information is displayed in the  console.   Beware:  using  this
              switch disables any overwrite check. Use it with care!

       --silent, -s
              Skip  questions  in  no  GUI  mode. Should be used with --no-gui
              switch.

       --calc=CALC, CALC
              Select a calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89t, ti89,  ti86,
              ti85, ti84+, ti83+, ti83, ti82 or ti73.

       --cable=CABLE, CABLE
              Select a link cable type: GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, Silver-
              Link, DirectLink, VTi, TiEmu.

       --port=PORT, -pPORT
              Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can be null,
              1, 2, 3 or 4.

       --timeout=TIMEOUT, -tTIMEOUT
              in  tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while the program
              wait a response of the calculator. Once this delay elapsed,  the
              program send a time out error. The default value is 1 seconds.

       --delay=DELAY, -dDELAY
              in  microseconds.  This is the time which separate the transmis-
              sion of 2 bytes.  The default value is 5 microseconds.  Decrease
              this  value  increase the transfer speed but decrease the relia-
              bility of the transmission.

EXAMPLE
       Quicly send (no gui) an TI89 file with a BlackLink cable on the  second
       serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2); timeout is set to 2s:

       tilp   --calc=ti89  --cable=BlackLink  --port=2  --timeout=20  --no-gui
       group.89g

       Starting at version 1.13, a new & shorter syntax can be used:

       tilp ti89 blacklink -p2 -t20 -n group.89g


CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is  in
       the  home  directory  of the user (Linux) or the tilp.ini file (Win32).
       The file is separated  into  several  sections  (hardware,  gui,  calc,
       external  programs,  fonts,  screen, misc). But, there is no order, you
       can write lines as you want.  A line preceded by the '#'  symbol  is  a
       comment.  Each  line has the following format: option=something.  Every
       line can be put in any order. Beware: any comment  added  to  the  file
       will  be overwritten !  Below is described each option and the possible
       values:

       version= Which version of TiLP has written the  config  file.  Used  to
       display the Release the file and to keep compatibility.
