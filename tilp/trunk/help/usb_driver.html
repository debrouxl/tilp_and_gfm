Starting at TiLP v1.07, you don't need to download and install the
LPG's USB <a href="http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_usb/">driver</a> any
more. It has been
replaced by libusb-win32 one which has auto-registering capabilities.
This driver is bundled with TiLP and TiEmu. Now, the TiLP installer
copies and installs those USB drivers
automagically.<br>
<br>
Please note those drivers are not compatible with Ti-Connect(tm) and
they
will replace TI's drivers.<br>
<br>
If you need to manually install them, they are located in C:\Program
Files\{Common Files}\LPG Shared\drivers\usb. {Common Files} is locale
dependent (aka depending on your platform language).<br>
A anonymous contributor has written this document which can be used for
manual installation of TiLP driver:<br>
<pre>1) Connect your calculator and turn it on.<br>2) Right-click "My Computer" and choose "Properties" out of the drop-down menu.<br>3) Click on the "Hardware" tab, then click the "Device Manager" button.<br>4) At the bottom should be "Universal Serial Bus controllers". Expand the list<br>(by clicking on the plus sign next to it).<br><br>5) In the list should be "TI Educational Handheld Device". Right-click it, and<br>choose "Update Driver..." from the drop-down menu.<br><br>6) At this time, the Hardware Update Wizard should pop up. It may ask you if<br>you want to connect to Windows Update to search for the driver. If not, go to<br>the next step, otherwise, click the button by "No, not at this time" and then<br>click next.<br><br>7) Click the button next to "Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)",<br>then click next.<br>8) Make sure the check box next to "Include this location in the search:" is<br>selected, then click the "Browse" button.<br><br>9) Browse to the driver folder. Click "OK" on the "Browse<br>For Folder" window, then "Next" on the Hardware Update Wizard window.<br><br>10)Now Windows should install the driver. In the middle you may get a warning<br>about the driver not being digitally signed. Just click "Continue Anyway".<br><br>11)Click finish on the Hardware Update Wizard. If everything's gone according<br>to plan, TiLP should work properly now! :) Also, when you go back to "Device<br>Driver", it will say "TI-GRAPH/DIRECT LINK USB" in place of "TI Educational<br>Handheld Device" (so long as your calculator is on and connected ;) ).<br><br>Hope this helps.
