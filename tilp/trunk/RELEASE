New capabilities:
-----------------
	- in libticalcs, the ability to send and receive raw DBUS, DUSB and NSP packets (wrapped into in TI's format for header, checksum, etc.).
	- variable rename and variable attribute change functions, mainly by Benjamin Moody.
	- new TI-Z80 ROM dumper by Benjamin Moody, with, among others, the ability to automatically dump 82 and 85, and the ability to unlock 73/83+/84+ Flash memory without an OS patch.
	- the ability to obtain screenshots from TI-80 VSC, by Randy Compton.
	- the ability to transfer Nspire OS extensions, currently limited to English-Chinese dictionaries.
	- Nspire remote control feature.
	- in libticalcs, the ability to send DUSB virtual packets, DUSB commands, 83+ family DUSB commands (including the new 83+ family DBUS memory dump command).
	- temporary kludge for sending 84+CSE Pic files. Patch by Benjamin Moody.

Improvements:
-------------
	- USB scan at startup (options.auto_detect) is now enabled by default, to be more intuitive to users of TI's official software.
	- make the install_tilp.sh script sensitive to PREFIX and SRCDIR environment variables; abort early when $PREFIX cannot be written to.
	- improve test_ticalcs_2 (multiple times).
	- upgrade GTK+ runtime from 2.12.9 to 2.24.8.
	- switch from Glade to GTK+Builder for the TILP interface.
	- integrated tf2hex and the ROM dumpers into the autotools chain, by Benjamin Moody.
	- switched the source code and building process of the TI-Z80 ROM dumpers from tasm to spasm, by Benjamin Moody.
	- optimized the TI-68k ROM dumpers
	- improved raw mode external linking, thanks to two new functions for setting both lines simultaneously, by Benjamin Moody.
	- on Windows, load libusb-win32 dynamically if available, and fail gracefully if it's missing.
	- in 84+ DUSB ROM dumper, enabled UnlockFlash, so that the certificate page can be dumped.
	- switched the code for dealing with ZIP files from an embedded minizip to an external libarchive.
	- improve the comment of tifiles_file_read_regular. Reformat files8x.c, files9x.c, filesnsp.c and add traces.
	- when communicating with 84+ through DUSB, allow variables with the same name but different types, by Benjamin Moody.
	- add known 84+CSE hardware version, and plausible default model for unknown hardware versions. Reported by Benjamin Moody.
	- install_tilp.sh: add ready-made `apt-get install` command line for Debian & derivatives.
	- redirect log output to a file, better way. Patch by Benjamin Moody.
	- compile with -mwindows, so as to disable the command-line window.

Bug fixes:
----------
	- fixed 84+ product ID retrieval.
	- now honoring CFLAGS when compiling gfm & tilp "cleaner".
	- fixed FreeDesktop .desktop files (two steps).
	- now advertising ROM dumping support in CalcFncts calc_84p_usb.
	- suppressed name clashes between libticalcs' dusb_rpkt.h / nsp_rpkt.h and dusb_vpkt.h / nsp_vpkt.h.
	- protected {dbus,dusb,nsp}_{recv,send}, and other DUSB / NSP functions, against NULL parameters.
	- fixed several malloc/realloc/free vs. g_malloc/g_malloc0/g_free mismatches.
	- applied downstream Debian patches for fixing FTBFS on sh390x (Debian bug #641092), sh4 (Debian bug #567679) and sparc64 (Debian bug #596601).
	- made Glib 2.32 and later print info and debug messages, restoring the behaviour of older versions.
	- integrated a couple fixes to the 84+ DUSB ROM dumper, by Benjamin Moody.
	- fixed spelling errors reported by alberthro and TC01.
	- fixed i18n problems reported by Benjamin Moody.
	- fixed 32-on-64 support, and 64-bit serial support, in the Windows installer, both reported by Benjamin Moody.
	- updated "counters" arrays in CalcFncts instances. They had been broken for years.
	- defined combobox semantics in XML and retrieving them from C, instead of having two desynchronized definitions.
	- fixed two detokenization issues. This patch by Benjamin Moody.
	- fixed a number of problems related to unaligned reads/writes and left shifts of count >= width of type.
	- fixed more compiler warnings.
	- now compiling manpage cleaner with host compiler (borrowing Benjamin Moody's code from libticalcs' configure).
	- fix xbar and ybar TI-68k charset definitions: the combining overline should be after x and y.
	- fix crash reported by Deathrider.
	- add -Werror=implicit-function-declaration to maintainer scripts, and fix a couple warnings turned errors in the Windows code.
	- installer: use libusb0.dll to install driver on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, instead of either libusb0_x86.dll or libusb.dll. Patch by Benjamin Moody.
	- try to fix an elusive BSOD, reported by multiple persons, possibly introduced by SVN r4428: don't pass $CFLAGS and $CPPFLAGS to $CC when compiling dhahelper.
	- remove some MinGW special-casing. Reported by Jonimus and tifreak, discussed with Jonimus and Benjamin Moody.

Known bugs:
-----------

	- [nspire] sometimes need to restart TiLP if connection fails
	- [linux] Titanium DirectLink support works but:
		* w/ libusb: you will have to replug link cable whenever you exit TiLP
		=> this bug is due to the Titanium USB internal firmware
